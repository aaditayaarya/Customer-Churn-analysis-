Exploring Customer Churn with Python 🐍
Hey everyone,

I just wrapped up my first exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Python, and I’m excited to share it! 🚀 In this project, I analyzed customer churn data, visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, and uncovered some interesting patterns related to customer behavior.

Some key insights include:
📌 How different services impact churn rates
📌 The role of customer demographics (like senior citizens)
📌 Factors contributing to higher churn in certain segments

This was a great learning experience, and I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions! If you're interested, check out the project here:

Let’s connect and discuss! Looking forward to your feedback.
